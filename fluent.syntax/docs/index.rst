Fluent Syntax
=============

The :py:mod:`org.projectfluent:syntax` library is built for tooling around Fluent. It's
designed to parse, analyze, process, and serialize Fluent files.

The :py:mod:`org.projectfluent:syntax.visitor` package implements ``Visitor`` and
``childrenOf`` patterns, which are the recommended interfaces to be used in analysis
and post-processing of Fluent source files.
